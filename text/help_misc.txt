If you spot any data mistake like a wrong base stat or growth, or a command acting weird, **I ask you to please report it in the support server.** [The invite for it can be found clicking here.](https://discord.com/invite/uK66FQE)

You can add Oifey to your server by clicking his Discord profile and clicking the "Add to Server" button!

More games and more features for them are (very) slowly getting added. 
Hope I can be useful to you!
